 WeatherVariationConsoleApp is an app which reads a txt file containing weather data and it works specifically with two specific columns (MxT and MnT).
It adds the numerical values from these two columns into arrays and then iterates the arrays to find the day of the month which has the least difference (variation) between min and max temperatures.

The weather.txt file must be present for the app to load to the main menu. If it's not found it notifies the user and then exits completely.
